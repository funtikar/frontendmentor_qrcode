## My process

### Built with

- Basic HTML5
- CSS


### What I learned

1. **Importing External Fonts:**
   - `@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Outfit&display=swap');`
     - This line imports the "Outfit" font from Google Fonts and applies it to elements using that font-family.

2. **Selectors:**
   - `.attribution`, `.attribution a`, `body`, `#card`, `img`, `h2`, `p`
     - These are various CSS selectors used to target specific HTML elements for styling.

3. **Font Size:**
   - `.attribution { font-size: 11px; }`
     - Sets the font size of elements with the class `attribution` to 11 pixels.

4. **Text Alignment:**
   - `.attribution { text-align: center; }`
   - `h2 { text-align: center; }`
   - `p { text-align: center; }`
     - These lines set the text alignment for elements with the mentioned classes or tags to center.

5. **Link Styling:**
   - `.attribution a { color: hsl(228, 45%, 44%); }`
     - Styles the color of links within elements with the class `attribution`.

6. **Background Color:**
   - `body { background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%); }`
     - Sets the background color of the entire page to a light hsl(212, 45%, 89%).

7. **Box Model:**
   - `#card { width: 15%; padding: 17px; border-radius: 20px; margin: 170px auto auto auto; }`
     - Defines the width, padding, border-radius, and margins of the element with the ID `card`.

8. **Image Styling:**
   - `img { border-radius: 10px; width: 100%; }`
     - Applies styling to all `img` elements, setting border-radius and width to 10 pixels and 100%, respectively.

9. **Font Family:**
   - `h2 { font-family: "Outfit"; }`
   - `p { font-family: "Outfit"; }`
     - Specifies the "Outfit" font family for the `h2` and `p` elements.

10. **Font Color and Weight:**
    - `h2 { color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%); font-weight: 700; }`
    - `p { color: hsl(220, 15%, 55%); font-weight: 400; }`
      - Defines the font color and weight for `h2` and `p` elements.

### Continued development

This same project will probably be forked and be remade using preprocessors in CSS and "refactored"

### Useful resources
- ChatGPT (No, not that in that sense that I generated the code from ChatGPT , its for learning nuanced things like is this how people usually do font importing? or is it this way. ) Basically for things that I can't google I will ask ChatGPT as a tutor
